                Hi, my name is Kelly Pressley. I completed a Full-Stack Bootcamp at the University
                of Arizon. I'm pretty fluent in JavaScript whether its DOM manipulation or making API calls. I built
                this website using React and a little help from Google.
                Please feel free to look at the links at the bottom of the page for some of my projects.
                Contact me if you have any questions or comments. Also my GitHub, LinkedIn, and
                StackOverflow are other ways to conect with me. Links are at the bottom of the page.

                        Hi, my name is Kelly Pressley. I recently finished a Full-Stack Bootcamp at the University
                        of Arizon. I'm pretty fluent in JavaScript whether its DOM manipulation or making API calls. I built
                        this website using React and a little help from Google.
                        Please feel free to look at my <a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio </a> for some of my recent projects.
                        <a href="#Contact"> Contact</a> me if you have any questions or comments. Also my GitHub, LinkedIn, and
                        StackOverflow are other ways to conect with me. Links are at the bottom of the page.
